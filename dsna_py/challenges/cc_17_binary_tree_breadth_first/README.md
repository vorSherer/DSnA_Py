# Breadth-first traversal of a Binary Tree

## Challenge Description
Write a __breadth-first traversal__ method which takes a __Binary Tree__ as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and __*return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered*__. <br>

## Approach & Efficiency
Utilize a __queue__ structure for the traversal:

__Big O space complexity__ for this approach is __`O(1)`__ <br>
__Big O time complexity__ for this approach is __`O(n)`__ <br>

My code is [here](./breadth_first_traversal.py)
