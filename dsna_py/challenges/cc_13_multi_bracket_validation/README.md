# Multi-bracket Validation
Given a string input, test to see whether any "brackets" (i.e., parentheses, square or curly brackets) it contains are correctly matched (each opening "bracket" is met with a corresponding closing "bracket" before a non-matching closing "bracket" is encountered) and return a boolean result.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called multi_bracket_validation which take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:
Round Brackets : ()
Square Brackets : []
Curly Brackets : {}

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided upon an iterative approach to traverse the string. <br>

Big O space for this approach is O(n) <br>
Big O time for this approach is O(n) <br>
