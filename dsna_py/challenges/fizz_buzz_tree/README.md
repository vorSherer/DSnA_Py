# FizzBuzzTree
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

Set the values of each of the new nodes depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

## Challenge 18
- Write a function called __`FizzBuzzTree`__ which takes a __k-ary tree__ as an argument.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
	- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with __*"Fizz"*__
	- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with __*"Buzz"*__
	- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with __*"FizzBuzz"*__.
	- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a __String__. <br>
- Return a __*new*__ tree.

- Write unit tests.

## Approach & Efficiency
__Big O space complexity__ for this approach is __`O(n)`__ <br>
__Big O time complexity__ for this approach is __`O(n)`__ <br>

## API
Descriptions of TreeNode method publicly available to my k-ary tree instantiates a node with a number of children determined by the argument passed in.

My code is [here](./fizz_buzz_tree.py)
