# Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## Challenge Description
Write an instance method called __`find-maximum-value`__. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the __Binary Tree__ will be numeric. <br>

## Approach & Efficiency
Utilize the __Call Stack__ for the traversal method:

__Big O space complexity__ for this approach is __`O(1)`__ <br>
__Big O time complexity__ for this approach is __`O(n)`__ <br>

My code is [here](./find_max_value.py)
