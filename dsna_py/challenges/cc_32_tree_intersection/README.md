# Binary Search Trees - Tree Intersection
Find common values in 2 binary trees. <br>

## Specifications
- Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
- Create a branch in your repository called __`tree-intersection`__
- On your branch, create a folder named __`tree_intersection`__ which contains a file called __`tree_intersection.py`__ <br>

- Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
	- __*NOTE:*__ You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.

## Feature Tasks
- Write a function called __`tree_intersection`__ that takes two binary tree parameters.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Structure and Testing
Utilize the __*Single-responsibility principle*__: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- __Big O space complexity__ for this approach is __`O(n)`__ <br>
__Big O time complexity__ for this approach is __`O(n)`__ <br>
__Big O time complexity for insertion/deletion__ is __`O(1)`__ <br> -->

## API
<!-- This implementation has access to all functionality of my Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree classes. -->

My code is [here](./tree_intersection.py)
